# ICB

Industry Classification Benchmark

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Classification_Benchmark

The ICB was launched by Dow Jones and FTSE in 2005 and replaced the legacy FTSE and Dow Jones classification systems on 3 January 2006.
Dow Jones divested itself of its 50% interest in the ICB in 2011 and announced it was creating its own version of it.

The ICB is used today by FTSE International, STOXX, NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

The ICB recognizes 10 industries, partitioned into 19 supersectors, which are further divided into 41 sectors, which then contain 114 subsectors.
