    /// <para />
    /// ❶ UpMove = today's high − yesterday's high
    /// <para />
    /// ❷ DownMove = yesterday's low − today's low
    /// <para />

    /// <para />

    /// <para />
    /// ❶ +DI = 100 times +DM divided by average true range
    /// <para />
    /// ❷ −DI = 100 times −DM divided by average true range
    /// <para />
    /// The value of the DX is calculated as:
    /// <para />
    /// DX = 100 |-DI - +DI| / (-DI + +DI14)
    /// Then, the value of the ADX is calculated as:
    /// <para />
    /// ADX = (previousADX (14-1) + DX) / 14, where the very first ADX is the simple average of the first 14 DX values.
