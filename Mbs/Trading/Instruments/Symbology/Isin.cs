    /// An International Securities Identifying Number (ISIN) uniquely identifies a security. Its structure is
    /// defined in ISO 6166. Securities for which ISINs are issued include bonds, commercial paper, equities
    /// and warrants. The ISIN code is a 12-character alpha-numerical code that does not contain information
    /// characterizing financial instruments but serves for uniform identification of a security at trading and
    /// settlement.
    /// </para><para>
    /// Securities with which ISINs can be used include debt securities, shares, options, derivatives and
    /// futures. The ISIN identifies the security, not the exchange (if any) on which it trades; it is not a
    /// ticker symbol. For instance, DaimlerChrysler stock trades on twenty-two different stock exchanges
    /// worldwide, and is priced in five different currencies; it has the same ISIN on each, though not the
    /// same ticker symbol. ISIN cannot specify a particular trade in this case, and another identifier,
    /// typically the three-letter exchange code, will have to be specified in addition to the ISIN.
    /// </para><para>
    /// ISINs consist of three parts: a two letter country code, a nine character alpha-numeric national
    /// security identifier, and a single check digit. The country code is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the
    /// country of issue, which is not necessarily the country in which the issuing company is domiciled.
    /// International securities cleared through Clearstream or Euroclear, which are Europe-wide, use "XS" as
    /// the country code.
    /// </para><para>
    /// The nine-digit security identifier is the National Securities Identifying Number, or NSIN, assigned by
    /// governing bodies in each country, known as the national numbering agency (NNA). In North America the
    /// NNA is the CUSIP organization, meaning that CUSIPs can easily be converted into ISINs by adding the US
    /// or CA country code to the beginning of the existing CUSIP code and adding an additional check digit at
    /// the end. In the United Kingdom and Ireland the NNA is the London Stock Exchange and the NSIN is the
    /// SEDOL, converted in a similar fashion after padding the SEDOL number out with leading zeros. Most other
    /// countries use similar conversions, but if no country NNA exists then regional NNAs are used instead.
    /// </para><para>
    /// ISIN check digits are based on the same "Modulus 10 Double Add Double" technique used in CUSIPs. To
    /// calculate the check digit, first convert any letters to numbers by adding their ordinal position in the
    /// alphabet to 9, such that A = 10 and M = 22. Starting with the right most digit, every other digit is
    /// multiplied by two. The resulting string of digits (numbers greater than 9 becoming two separate digits)
    /// are added up. Subtract this sum from the smallest number ending with zero that is greater than or equal
    /// to it: this gives the check digit which is also known as the ten's complement of the sum modulo 10.
